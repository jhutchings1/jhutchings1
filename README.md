Hello! I'm Justin Hutchings, and I'm a product manager here at GitHub working on our security features for developers. 

I'm currently working on our supply chain security features including [@Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot), the [Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories), and the dependency graph. 

Previously, I worked on the integration of [Semmle's super cool CodeQL into GitHub](https://semmle.com/) with [code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/about-code-scanning).
