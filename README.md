I'm a Product Manager at GitHub working on our Security team on a feature we call [code scanning](https://help.github.com/en/github/finding-security-vulnerabilities-and-errors-in-your-code/about-code-scanning). If you haven't already, please [sign up](https://github.com/features/security/advanced-security/signup) to give it a try!
